# Docker Test Success ✓

## Test Run: 2025-10-19

Successfully tested NARA import in Docker locally before EC2 deployment.

### Test Results

```
=== Import Statistics ===
Institutions created: 1
Collections created:  1
Series created:       2
FileUnits created:    3
DigitalObjects:       13
Bytes hashed:         16,302,937
Errors:               0
========================
```

### What Was Tested

- Production API connectivity: `https://api.arke.institute` ✓
- Docker image build ✓
- Full import pipeline (3 sample records) ✓
- Hash computation from S3 files ✓
- Entity creation with bidirectional linking ✓
- All dependencies properly installed ✓

### How to Run

```bash
cd deployment/docker
docker build -t nara-import -f Dockerfile ../..
docker run --rm nara-import python test_import_sample.py
```

### Next Steps

With local Docker test successful, ready to deploy to EC2:
1. User-data scripts will use same Docker image
2. Expected behavior: import completes, instance auto-shuts down
3. Full import: 2,053 file units, 4-8 hours

**Local testing validated!** Ready for cloud deployment.
